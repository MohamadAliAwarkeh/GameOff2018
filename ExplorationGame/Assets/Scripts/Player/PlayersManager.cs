//Players Manager is a script that handles connect players from existing devices.
//I am using an InputManager.OnDeviceDetached so we can reference which controller is stored
//for each players and to know when one is detached.
//
//To detect a player joining, we will simply check the current active device (Which is the last
//device to provide input) for a relevant button press, check if it is or is not already assigned
//to a player, and then create a new player for it.
//
//There are a few limitations that could be easily worked around but for now I will stick with 
//this, but at a later date, I might work on further implementing it where if a player disconnects
//then a UI pop up will appear pausing the game stating a controller has been disconnected, and
//to resume the game, players must reconnect that controller.
